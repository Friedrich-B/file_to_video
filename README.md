This is a tool to convert any file to a video and convert the video back to the original file.

## Why? ##

There was a video on YouTube where a guy presented his idea of using YouTube as an unlimmited cloud storage.
To achieve this you need to be able to convert files into videos and to convert them back.
Feel free to build an uploader/downloader for your YouTube videos using Google's developer api and this little tool here.
